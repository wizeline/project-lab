## How to contribute to ProjectLab

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [project](https://github.com/wizeline/project-lab/projects/1).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/wizeline/project-lab/projects/1). Be sure the issue is in the Backlog column, so it can be reviewed and then added to the To do column, also be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

- If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to ProjectLab](https://github.com/wizeline/project-lab/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Suggest your change in the [slack channel](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=CQCB5MWG6) and start writing code.

- Please open an issue on GitHub and try to attend the meetings so everyone can hear and understand your request. In this is not possible, contact any of the principal stakeholders.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

- Ask any question about how to use Ruby on Rails in the [slack channel](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=CQCB5MWG6).

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
